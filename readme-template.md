# cull.js

Cull is a toolbelt for writing functional javascript. It is based on
these core values:

 * **Pure JavaScript** - no programming in strings
 * **Pure functions** - prefer side-effect free functions wherever possible
 * **No chaining** - chaining obscures side-effects and invites spaghetti code
 * **No wrapping** - work with native arrays and DOM elements
 * **Fail early** - complains loudly about API misuse in development

This is totally a work in progress. The API may change until we reach
the big one-oh.

## A consistent API

In an effort to create a consistent API, here are some basic function
parameter guidelines:

### Function first, collection second

The readability of

    map(name, filter(underage, persons))

over

    map(filter(persons, underage), name)

tells us which order to put the parameters. It is hard to spot what
`name` belongs to, dangling at the end. This gets harder with more
nested functions.

You might argue that when you inline the functions, the second form
looks better. For maximum visual pleasure, don't inline your
functions.
