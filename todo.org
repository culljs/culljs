#+SEQ_TODO: OPEN TODO INPR | DONE DONT
* API change suggestions [0/2]
** OPEN Rename `each` to `do`
   `do` works better with the signature (fn, seq). `each` lends itself more to
   having the sequence first:

   each(students, expell);

   vs

   do(expell, students);
** OPEN Remove `fn.handler`
   Usage of the handler method includes such peculiarities as:

*** F.handler(this.onSelection, "onSelection")(this.getSelected(), {})

    Hmm?

*** onSelection: backend
    Object as callback? What?
